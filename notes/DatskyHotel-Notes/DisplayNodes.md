DisplayNodes are the visual representation of [[Room]]s and Connections in the Hotel. They attach to the [[HotelDisplay]], which itself is not quite a DisplayNode but the representation for the whole Hotel. The [[HotelDisplay]] can be attached to a Scene to display the hotel there.

There is also the [[HabitantDisplay]] which displays the Habitant Character. It is used to handle all animations, clothing and similar visual aspects of the Habitant.
