A Relationship can exist between two or more [[Habitant]]s. It is generally created between two Habitants, but can be expanded to more Habitants, if one of the Habitants of a Relationship exposes new Habitants to the Relationship.

A Relationship of more Habitants shall result in less binding. And some Relationships shall crumble if any of the Habitants inside the Relationship use it to form a Romance to another Habitant inside the Relationship.

There cannot be multiple Relationships with the same set of Habitants, but subsets are ok. So if Habitant X and Y know each other, Y also has a friendship to Z, there can still be a friend group of X, Y and Z. The X, Y and Z group will only crumble under a romance of X and Y if they use the friend group to romance.
